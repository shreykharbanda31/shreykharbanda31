### Hello, I'm Shrey ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science along with two Minors in Web Programming and Applications and Mathematics at New York University's School of Engineering - NYU Tandon.

I enjoy NLP, Web Dev, Android, Back-End, Quant, iOS, and Software Dev in particular. I direct NYU's premier hackathon club, [HackNYU](https://hacknyu.org/) and actively research @ NYU's [mLAB](https://hdanny.org/).

### Hello, I'm (Sh)rey ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science along with two Minors in Web Programming and Applications and Mathematics at New York University's School of Engineering - NYU Tandon.

I enjoy Platform Tech, Finance Solutions, Web Dev, Android, Back-End, Quant, iOS, and Software Dev in particular. After directing the organization for 2 years, I advise the board at NYU's premier hackathon club, [HackNYU](https://hacknyu.org/). I also enjoy travelling, cooking, and boxing - feel free to reach out to me:
